# Lab 5: Vector space semantic modeling

In this lab, you'll be building neural word embedding models using a new library, gensim. This lab is due Friday, February 28, 11:59pm EST.

### Overview 
1. Clone the lab repo down to your own machine.
2. Complete the lab in the Colab notebook, as described below in Parts 1 and 2. 
3. Share your Colab notebook with me and the TAs, as described in the notebook.
4. Download, add, commit, and push your notebook to your repo. 


### Part 1: Getting your own copy of the Colab notebook.

[Here's a link to the Colab notebook for lab 5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SeFU2xJUnA3XM3zkeebfW_XViePgRgIK?usp=sharing). Remember you need to save a copy in your drive to start editing!


### Part 2: Complete the Colab notebook
* Follow the instructions in the [Colab notebook for Lab 5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SeFU2xJUnA3XM3zkeebfW_XViePgRgIK?usp=sharing) to create your own copy of the notebook.
* Edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.

### Part 3: Submit your work

* When your notebook is complete, share the notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
* Download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you did for prior labs.
* **Do not alter the Colab notebook after the deadline.** If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late. If you happen to do it, let the TAs know so they can refer to the version you submitted to GitHub instead.
